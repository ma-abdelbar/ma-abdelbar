# Mohamed A. Abdelbar

I'm a computational scientist with a multidisciplinary background in **physics**, **materials science**, and **engineering**. This profile hosts a collection of personal and academic projects. I specialize in **molecular simulations**, **data-driven modeling**, and **high-performance computing (HPC)**, combining a strong theoretical foundation with practical coding and simulation expertise. I take particular interest in the intersection between simulation, data, and real-world engineering problem.

## Research Focus

My doctoral research at *Imperial College London* explored how polymer brush architecture influences frictional behavior, using coarse-grained simulations. The aim: to derive design principles for tunable, low-friction materials.

Iâ€™m especially drawn to problems that require both **deep domain knowledge** and **technical fluency**â€”be it in setting up large-scale simulations, analyzing emergent behavior, or building reproducible research workflows.
